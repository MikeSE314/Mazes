# Mazes

### how to run:

Copy the file `eller.py` into a directory.

Within the terminal, navigate to that directory, and enter the command `python eller.py`.

Hit `<enter>` to generate new rows, and `q <enter>` to quit.

You can also adjust the width of the maze, with `python eller.py 20` to change it to 20 cells wide, or any arbitrary length.

If you'd like to know how this works, I learned it from Jamis Buck, on [his blog](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/29/maze-generation-eller-s-algorithm).
